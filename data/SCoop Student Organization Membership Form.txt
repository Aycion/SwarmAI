Brief Description of Org. (meetings, projects, events, etc)
Your answer
Open Sourcery is dedicated to promoting open-sourced software
development in all forms. We encourage members to develop their own
open-source projects and collaborate with other members. Our meetings
include time for members to show what they've been working on,
brainstorm new ideas, and form groups for new projects. Some meetings–on
a regular basis–are dedicated to a workshop or seminar on a programming
topic of some kind, led either by a club member or a guest speaker. In
the future we hope to host larger, multi-day events called hackathons
for people to compete by creating something in a short amount of time.
